        "[PHONE]:\n\Hello? Hello, hello?",
        "[PHONE]:\n\nHello and welcome to your new job.\n\nEach night, I'll give you some instructions to follow.",
        "[PHONE]:\n\nYou must do all your tasks before 6 AM, otherwise you will be fired.\n\nYou can see your current task at the left of your screen.",
        "[PHONE]:\n\nYou can move freely in the restaurant using the 'mv' command.\n\nBe careful to spell it correctly though, as syntax errors will fail the command.",
        "[PHONE]:\n\nI must warn your that you are NOT alone in the restaurant; the animatronics\n\nthat entertain children during the day, will be moving freely during the night.",
        "[PHONE]:\n\nTonight, only Freddy, Bonnie and Chica can move; they are normally on the Main Stage.\n\nFoxy and Mangle are currently under repair, don't worry about them.",
        "[PHONE]:\n\nIf some animatronics are near you, use the 'hide' command\n\nto hide and prevent them from attacking you.",
        "[PHONE]:\n\nIf you want to avoid them, use the 'cam' command\n\nto check the rooms of the restaurant to check where they are.",
        "[PHONE]:\n\nOnce all your tasks are done, you are free to leave, and come back next night to work again.",
        "[PHONE]:\n\nThat will be all for tonight, more instructions will follow next night. Now, let's start to work!",

        "[PHONE]:\n\nHey, congratulations on passing the first night.\n\nI'll now give you some instructions to follow.",
        "[PHONE]:\n\nFoxy and Mangle are now functionning properly,\n\nand will start roaming around too.",
        "[PHONE]:\n\nMangle loves to use vents to move faster,\n\nbut it might causes an ventilation error.",
        "[PHONE]:\n\nFoxy is a bit weird: he won't move a lot, but once he moves, you'd better hide.\n\nIndeed, He will ALWAYS find you, so just hide, okay?",
        "[PHONE]:\n\nAbout systems: sometimes, something will be jammed.\n\nIf that ever happens, just go where the alarm is and fix it with the 'fix' command.",
        "[PHONE]:\n\nThat will be all for tonight.",

        "[PHONE]:\n\nYou might have already used it, but if you didn't know,\n\nyou have a noise-maker available.",
        "[PHONE]:\n\nUsing the 'noise' command, you can drop a noise-maker where you are,\n\nthat will attract the animatronics.",
        "[PHONE]:\n\nYou can use it to make them go somewhere, and do tasks somewhere else.\n\nYou can turn off the noise-maker using the 'noise off' command.",
        "[PHONE]:\n\nNevertheless, you must be careful with your power usage:\n\nhiding, using noises or cameras use power.",
        "[PHONE]:\n\nIf you run out of power, everything will be shut down.\n\nYou will still be able to move and task, but not for long...",

        "[PHONE]:\n\nThe owner said that the police found a kid's body in a suit.\n\nIt's... really messed up.",
        "[PHONE]:\n\nAnyway, tomorrow will be your LAST day, okay?",
        "[PHONE]:\n\nAlso, some clients are saying the animatronics are acting weird lately.\n\nWatch out tonight, they might not be... friendly, with you.",

        "[PHONE]:\n\nSo... about the dead body... There is an investigation going on.\n\nYou're the main suspect from what I've heard, the police will probably question you.",
        "[PHONE]:\n\nBut we both know it's not you, right? Well, it's a pre-recorded message,\n\nso I can't hear you, but you probably agreed, of course.",

        "[PHONE]:\n\nYou... You shouldn't be there. The animatronics have gone mad.\nYou... are not safe here.",
        "[PHONE]:\n\nYou don't have any task to do, but you can't leave.\n\nThe door locked at midnight, and only the owner has the key...",
        "[PHONE]:\n\nI... I'll send you some instructions to get out.\n\nDo them in order, and you'll be okay.",
        "[PHONE]:\n\nIf... there is anything... unusual around you...\n\njust run away from it, you know.",
        "[PHONE]:\n\nJust follow the instructions, okay? And be quick!",
